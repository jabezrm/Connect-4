# Connect 4 - Python Terminal Game
This is a Connect 4 game implemented in Python using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The project features a clean, class-based design for the game board, players, and game logic. The game is playable directly in the terminal and includes interactive menus, rules, gameplay examples, and tips for strategy.

## Key Features
- OOP Design: Uses a GameBoard class to manage game state, scoring, and moves.
- Interactive Gameplay: Two-player terminal-based game with turn-based moves.
- Dynamic Scoring System: Tracks points for vertical, horizontal, and diagonal sequences.
- User-Friendly Menu:
  - Rules and How to Play
  - Gameplay Examples (Horizontal, Vertical, Diagonal)
  - Tips and Tricks
  - Start Game
- Custom Board Size: Gameboard is configurable (e.g., 4x4, 6x6).
- Terminal Display: Visual representation of the board using O for Player 1 and X for Player 2.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Python Programming: Core syntax, loops, conditionals, and data structures.
- Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, methods, encapsulation, and state management.
- Algorithm Design:
  - Detects 4-in-a-row sequences in multiple directions.
  - Calculates dynamic scoring for extended sequences (5-in-a-row, 6-in-a-row, etc.).
  - Implements strategy helpers like column_resulting_in_max_points and middle-first logic.
- Terminal Interface: Interactive menus, page navigation, and real-time board updates.
